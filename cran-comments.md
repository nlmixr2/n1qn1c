## R CMD check results

Requested to fix the errors on CRAN (strict prototype errors).

These were checked (with the compile flag -Wstrict-prototypes) and fixed.

The pacakge `nlmixr2est` is a binary dependency of this package and
can be fixed by recompiling.  Since I am a developer of this package I plan to resubmit this
