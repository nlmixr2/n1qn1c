R port of the Scilab n1qn1 module.  This package provides n1qn1, or
Quasi-Newton BFGS "qn" without constraints.  This takes more memory
than traditional L-BFGS.  This routine is useful since it
allows prespecification of a Hessian; If the Hessian is near the truth
in optimization it can speed up the optimization problem.
